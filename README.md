## Description

Deep learning based Recommender systems Using Amazon Reviews

This project involves using a large dataset containing customer reviews and product information from Amazon to construct a recommender system. The aim is to leverage deep learning techniques to predict consumer preferences based on their consumption habits and product metadata. 

In this project, a hybrid recommendation model is implemented, combining a neural matrix factorization model with content-based models. This hybrid model integrates user-item interactions and item attributes, following the approach proposed by Zhang et al. (2017) for joint representation learning. The neural matrix factorization model's architecture is based on the framework proposed by Chakrabarti and Das (2019).
